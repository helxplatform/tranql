-- Workflow 5
--
--   Modules 1-4: Chemical Exposures by Clinical Clusters
--      For ICEES cohorts, eg, defined by differential population
--      density, which chemicals are associated with these
--      cohorts with a p_value lower than some threshold?
--
--   Modules 5-*: Knowledge Graph Phenotypic Associations 
--      For chemicals produced by steps 1-4, what phenotypes are
--      associated with exposure to these chemicals?
