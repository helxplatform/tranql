--
-- This query utilizes both the Gamma and RTX reasoners to get transitions between chemical substances and diseases.
-- It then utilizes solely the Gamma reasoner to get transitions between the unionized results of the previous transition and genes.
-- This query serves as a good example of the merging of a transition spanning multiple reasoners and the ability of a single reasoner to then successfully utilize it.
-- It is easy to observe the relatively homogeneous mixture of answers that arises from the query.
